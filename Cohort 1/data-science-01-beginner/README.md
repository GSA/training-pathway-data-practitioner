## About this class

Data science is an emerging field located at the intersection of social science, statistics, computer science, and human-centered design. This course takes a broad look at data science by providing you with an overview of data science terms, processes, roles, and workflows. You'll gain some insight as to why some data scientists use R and others prefer Python. You'll also be introduced to a sample data science project so that you can begin thinking about how to apply data science within GSA.

Course instruction will be instructor-led and hands-on with delivery conducted both in-person, as well as virtual.
