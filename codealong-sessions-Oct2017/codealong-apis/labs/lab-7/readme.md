# Lab 7 Readme

## Lab Goal
Identify additional datasets that could be useful as an API
Create a User Story for an API.


## Lab Steps

1. On a piece of paper, write the question: What information sources does GSA have?

2. Spend 1 minute writing as many answers as you can think of, with one line for each.

Example: City Pairs rates

3. For the items listed in step 2, identify the source organization or application. If you don't know, guess.

Example: GSA Travel Management sets City Pairs rates


3. For the items listed in step 2, identify 1 organization or application INSIDE GSA that might use this data. If you think they already use it, go ahead and list them anyway.

Example: Concur might use the city pairs rates from the API to set airline prices.

4. For the items listed in step 2, identify 1 agency or customer OUTSIDE GSA that might use this data. If you think they already use it, go ahead and list them anyway.

Example: Dept. of Treasury might use the City Pairs rates to estimate travel costs for employees.

5. Share ideas with the group.

6. As a group, select one potential API to write in user story format:

`As a < organization insider or outside >, I want < some type of information from the API > so that < some reason to use the information >.`

For example:

` As a < Dept. of Treasury travel planner >, I want <City Pairs airfares> so that <I can estimate travel costs for employees>`
