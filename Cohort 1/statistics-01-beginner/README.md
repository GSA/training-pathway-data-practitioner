## Pre-class Requirement

Completion of Data Science programming courses of choice (either R or Python) at the Beginner and Intermediate levels.

## What will we do?
By completing this class, you will:
- Understand core statistics concepts for data science
- Tackle key statistics concepts by programming them with code
- Gain familiarity with the tools of statistical thinking needed for data science
