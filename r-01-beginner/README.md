## About this class
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.  In this introduction to programming with R, you'll learn and practice key computer science fundamentals (such as expressions, variables, and data types) and then apply these elements to create your first R program. The class is designed for students with very little or no computing background.  

Course instruction will be instructor-led and hands-on with delivery conducted both in-person, as well as virtual.

## Pre-class Requirement
Students are required to have completed the OLU class “Fundamental Methods for Data Science in R” (course # df_dsfd_a01_it_enus) prior to registration and complete that course test with an 80% or better.

## What will we do?
By coding along with this class, you will:
- Understand programming basics 
- Get hands-on experience with performing basic R programming through Jupyter notebooks
- Learn how to assign variables and get to know the basic data types in R
- Begin basic statistical exploration to analyze data
