## About this 
Python is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular for data science. In this introduction to programming with Python, you'll learn and practice key computer science fundamentals (such as expressions, variables, and data types) and then apply these elements to create your first Python program. The class is designed for students with very little or no computing background.  

Course instruction will be instructor-led and hands-on with delivery conducted both in-person, as well as virtual. 

## Expected Duration
2 hours

## Pre-class Requirement
Students are required to have completed the OLU class “Python for Data Science” (course # sd_pyds_a01_it_enus) prior to registration and complete that course test with an 80% or better.
